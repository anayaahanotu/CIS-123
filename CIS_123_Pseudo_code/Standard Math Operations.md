# Instructions
**Problem Description**

Write a C++ program that prompts the user for two doubles and then prints:

- - The sum
    - The difference
    - The product
    - The average
    - The distance (absolute value of the difference)
    - The maximum (the larger of the two)
    - The minimum (the smaller of the two)
    - All numbers should show decimals with a max of 4 decimal places

Note: You will have to refer to some C++ documentation to complete this assignment. When referring to resources outside of the scope of our class you should Â get in the habit of citing your sources.Â

**Submission Details**:Â 

- You should submit an algorithm as comments in a C++ program file (.cpp)
	- Algorithm goes at the top.
- You should include your name as a comment at the top of the fileÂ 
- Your code should compile cleanly (zero errors).Â 
    - If your code does not compile, points will be deducted from your final grade.Â 
- Your algorithm should be written in plain English

# Algorithm
1. ask the number for 2 numbers and store the numbers in 2 variables
2. Make sure all outputted values display 4 decimal places.
3. find the sum of the numbers and print the sum
4. find the difference of the numbers and print the difference
5. find the product of the numbers and print the product
6. find the average of the numbers and print the average
7. find the distance of the numbers and print the distance
8. find the maximum of the numbers and print the maximum
9. find the minimum of the numbers and print the minimum
